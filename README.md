# Bonfire

The free, open-source, modern and secure alternative to Discord.

## Installation

Planned prerequisites are: PHP 8.1, composer, a supabase.io account, and a computer. Shared hosting may work? But it's unlikely, and I don't support them.

When we have actual files, move them all into your document root. After you've done that, set up a Supabase project, and optionally, a reCAPTCHA project.  
Fill .env with your secrets.

## Note about the `dotme` branch

The `dotme` branch **will be pushed into production after testing on Bonfireapp.me Staging.** As such, you should make preparations for the app to be on Windev servers. Basically, follow the release policies in the Wiki. (I haven't written them yet. But I will Soonâ„¢.)
